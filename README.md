# About

videoeffects-demo is a silly little demo for real-time videoeffects. It currently supports an image, a video or a webcam feed as input and can apply a chain of effects.

A demo can be found on http://nped.se/videoeffects-demo/

It should work in Firefox and Chrome. A developer release of Chrome is required for the webcam to work, see [webRTC](http://www.webrtc.org/running-the-demos).

## Credits

All credits for the actual effects should go to the [Seriously.js](http://seriouslyjs.org/) project.

The image and the video comes from [Sintel](http://www.sintel.org/).

Some credit for the layout is also due to the [Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) project. But don't blame them for my awful design!

## Backlog

- Add some sort of spinner when downloading the video file
- Make JSLint stop complain about the JavaScript...
- Let the user adjust parameters for the effects. This is already supported by Seriously.js.
- Add CSS transforms
